# Robotics Arduino Projects
Several Arduino projects created during the G12 Robotics course (TER4M1)

### MemoryGame
A _Simon Says_ type memory game. There are four buttons with a corresponding LED and a note played using a piezo speaker. Each level is randomly generated with an increasing number of buttons to press.

### MoodLamp
A music playing mood lamp. Three iconic tunes can be played using one of the three buttons. A RGB LED smoothly changes colour depending on the mood of the song being played.

### MorseReader
Morse code to text translator. The summative project for the course, the translator reads in a strip of paper with a series of black dots and dashes. A light sensor detects the morse code, and displays it on the serial monitor as text.

### Puppet
A servo-controlled marionette. A Minecraft character is controlled using strings connected to three servos. Three buttons make the man perform actions such as run or swing a pickaxe. A fourth button plays background music from the game.

### Romeo
Four-wheeled car powered using a Romeo. An ultrasonic sensor attached to the front detects for any obstacles, and attempts to navigate around them.
